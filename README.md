  makes the most sense for the current portfolio page,
  like making each event a box with a blog link,
  then embedding content within that.
  would also make it easier to search or filter by client or event

  likes how bright and visually light,
  and the sloped design

  desktop animations are overkill,
  but likes layout and splash page intro
