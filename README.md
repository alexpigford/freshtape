# Fresh Tape Media Website Revamp

## Competitors:

- [STN Digital](https://stndigital.com/)
- [Boulder Media House](https://www.bouldermediahouse.com/)

## Inspiration:

- [Omsom](https://omsom.com/)

  > "I think this is less the design and more the branding. But we do have bright colors."

- [Creative Review](https://www.creativereview.co.uk/)

  > "I think this probably makes the most sense for the portfolio page we have right now. Making each event a box with a blog link and then embedding content within that. Which would also make it searchable, or easier to filter by client or event."

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

  > "I like how bright and visually light this is - and the upward slow they have."

- [Make Me Pulse](https://www.makemepulse.com/)

  > "A little overkill with the animations on desktop. But I like the layout and the little splash page intro."

- Other:
  > "So, focus on the team and good vibes of Omsom, portfolio style of Creative Review, interactivity of Make Me Pulse. I don't know if Stripe is relevant. If you want to know the differentiators, we're all about the family. We see clients as friends and will do whatever we can to make magic happen. People genuinely enjoy working with us. So while others highlight more of the taelnt, our thing is highlighting our team and capabilities. Not who we've worked with."
